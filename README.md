**supervize** gives an "as fast as you can reach" view of device(s) and service(s) availability. Its purpose is to check things during changes to see if you don't break those things !
# Usage
## For one device
Suppose you have a device on your network and you want to monitor the availability of the following ports : ssh, http, https. You should use this command :
`watch 'echo device 10.11.12.13|supervize /dev/stdin ssh http https'`
If you prefer numbers...
`watch 'echo device 10.11.12.13|supervize /dev/stdin 22 80 443'`
## For many devices
Now if you want to monitor many devices, create a file for example devices.supervize...

<file>
device1		10.11.12.13
device2		10.45.46.47
...			...
deviceN		10.20.21.22
</file>

And call supervize with the file and the ports you want to check

`watch supervize devices.supervize ssh http https`
